Squirtle (ÊÜ®ÊÜ®) invites you to enjoy Hamburger! ÊÜ® shares the same pronunciation as ham, which means simple and plain in Chinese.

## Update

- 2022.03.06 - Update HamNet using [MMSegmentation](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmsegmentation). HamNet achieves SOTA performance for ResNet-101 backbone on ADE20K `val` set, enabling R101 to match modern backbones like [ResNeSt](https://github.com/zhanghang1989/ResNeSt), [Swin Transformer](https://github.com/microsoft/Swin-Transformer) or [ConvNeXt](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ConvNeXt) using similar computing budget. Code and [checkpoint](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ja_SwzMg0a2NFW1d5gqg91QKgJrjuGYy/view?usp=sharing) are available.

## Introduction

This repo provides the official implementation of Hamburger for further research. We sincerely hope that this paper can bring you inspiration about the Attention Mechanism, especially how **the low-rankness and the optimization-driven method** can help model the so-called *Global Information* in deep learning. We also highlight **Hamburger as a semi-implicit model and one-step gradient as an alternative for training both implicit and semi-implicit models**.

We model the global context issue as a low-rank completion problem and show that its optimization algorithms can help design global information blocks. This paper then proposes a series of Hamburgers, in which we employ the optimization algorithms for solving MDs to factorize the input representations into sub-matrices and reconstruct a low-rank embedding. Hamburgers with different MDs can perform favorably against the popular global context module self-attention when carefully coping with gradients back-propagated through MDs.
